## [v0.9.0]
wf-trio is a new workflow for the analysis of combined whole genome sequencing data from proband and both parents.
This open release supersedes our closed beta and is focused on the calling of small variants, structural variants, and pedigree phasing of variants for the discovery and characterisation of proband variants.
We look forward to seeing how our workflow supports your research.
